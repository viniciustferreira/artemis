This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

- Database creation

- Database initialization

- How to run the test suite

- Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

- Deployment instructions

## How to run the daily lunar email

To enqueue the daily lunar email job immediately:

    bin/rails cron:daily_lunar_email

Or with rake/bundle in any environment:

    bundle exec rake cron:daily_lunar_email RAILS_ENV=production

Notes:

- The mailer and job use the Rails `ActionMailer` and `ActiveJob` settings in your environment files.
- If you want a production scheduler, run Sidekiq with a scheduler (config/sidekiq_scheduler.yml and config/sidekiq.yml exist) or use system cron / Windows Task Scheduler to run the rake task daily.

## Sidekiq & Redis

This project supports using Sidekiq for background processing and scheduled jobs.

1. Add Redis and Sidekiq secrets

- Provision a Redis instance (managed options: Upstash, Redis Cloud, AWS ElastiCache, DigitalOcean Managed Redis). Copy the connection URL and add it to your environment as `REDIS_URL` (example: `redis://:password@hostname:6379/0`).
- In GitHub repo Settings → Secrets → Actions add `REDIS_URL` along with `DATABASE_URL`, `RAILS_MASTER_KEY`, and SMTP secrets.

2. Running Sidekiq locally

Set `REDIS_URL` locally (e.g., export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0) and start Sidekiq:

```bash
bundle exec sidekiq -C config/sidekiq.yml
```

3. Running Sidekiq in production

- Run a worker process on your host or platform (Procfile contains a `worker` entry). Example (Heroku/Render): `worker: bundle exec sidekiq -C config/sidekiq.yml`.
- Ensure `REDIS_URL` is set in your environment/secrets. Sidekiq will use `ENV['REDIS_URL']`.

4. Scheduling jobs

- This repo includes `config/sidekiq_scheduler.yml` and `config/sidekiq.yml` — when Sidekiq starts the initializer will load the cron schedule (requires `sidekiq-cron`). Configure the cron there (they currently contain `daily_lunar_email`).

If you'd like, I can provision a small Upstash Redis instance for you and add the required secrets to the repo, or add Sidekiq deployment instructions for your hosting provider.

## Using Upstash (example)

If you used Upstash to create a free Redis instance, you'll see two connection types in the dashboard: a REST API and a Redis (CLI/TLS) URL. Sidekiq requires the Redis URL (RESP/TLS) as `REDIS_URL`.

Example (do NOT commit this value; add it to GitHub Secrets):

    REDIS_URL=rediss://default:<UPSTASH_PASSWORD>@adapting-sunbeam-80687.upstash.io:6379/0

How to set the secret in GitHub:

1. Go to your repository → Settings → Secrets → Actions → New repository secret.
2. Name: `REDIS_URL` Value: the `rediss://...` string shown in Upstash.

Testing locally:

```bash
# set environment locally (replace <TOKEN> with your Upstash password)
export REDIS_URL='rediss://default:<TOKEN>@adapting-sunbeam-80687.upstash.io:6379/0'
redis-cli --tls -u redis://default:<TOKEN>@adapting-sunbeam-80687.upstash.io:6379 ping
# start Sidekiq
bundle exec sidekiq -C config/sidekiq.yml
```

I left the hostname above (`adapting-sunbeam-80687.upstash.io`) as an example since you provided it — replace `<TOKEN>` with the secret token from Upstash. Once `REDIS_URL` is configured, Sidekiq will connect automatically.
